# upload_models.sh — push trained triage ML artifacts to S3 so the next CodeBuild
# run bakes them into the Lambda image (see buildspec.yml pre_build).
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/upload_models.sh <local_artifacts_dir>
#
# Expects, in <local_artifacts_dir>, the outputs of the triagegeist-clinical-ai
# pipeline notebook:
#   artifacts.pkl                  (REQUIRED — n_folds, feature_names, label encoders,
#                                    mlp_models, mlp_scalers, meta_learner, opt_thresholds,
#                                    conformal sets; without it the ensemble stays disabled)
#   lgbm_fold{0..4}.txt            (REQUIRED — LightGBM boosters; any missing => ensemble off)
#   xgb_fold{0..4}.txt             (optional — enables stacking; else lgbm_only mode)
#   cat_fold{0..4}.txt             (optional — CatBoost; .txt format via save_model)
#
# artifacts.pkl is uploaded uncompressed; fold .txt files are gzipped to match the
# loader's S3 fetch path (models/<name>.txt.gz).
