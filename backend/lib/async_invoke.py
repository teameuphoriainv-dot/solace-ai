"""Deferred-work dispatch for the intake fast-path.

The intake endpoint must return well under API Gateway's 30s hard integration
timeout, but the clinician-only artifacts (prebrief, scribe, differential,
workup, disposition) need ~6 sequential Bedrock/Claude calls that overflow that
budget. We split them off: intake returns the patient-facing result fast, then
fires a *separate* asynchronous Lambda self-invocation that regenerates those
artifacts out-of-band and patches them onto the stored patient record.

AWS mode  → boto3 `invoke(InvocationType='Event')` against THIS function
            (name read from the AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME runtime env var). The
            actual boto3 client lives in db.storage (ARCH-002); this module only
            decides *whether/how* to dispatch.
Local mode → no Lambda exists, so we run the generation inline in a daemon thread
            (mirrors services.workflows.engine.fire) so local dev + tests still
            produce artifacts without blocking the response.

Never raises into the caller — intake has already returned the patient-facing
result by the time this runs; a dispatch failure must not surface to the patient.
