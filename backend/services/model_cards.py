"""Static model cards + bias-audit machinery for every AI surface in Solace.

Published at /api/model-cards (no auth) so procurement teams, CMIOs, and patients
can read what each model does, what data it was trained on, where it fails, and
what controls are in place. Aligns to HTI-1 DSI transparency requirements
(45 CFR 170.315(b)(11), effective 2025) and to the IEEE/MITRE model-card
structures used in peer-reviewed clinical AI publications.

HTI-1 source-attribute coverage
-------------------------------
HTI-1 requires Predictive Decision Support Interventions (DSIs) to disclose 31
"source attributes" across details, funding/development, validity, fairness,
risk-management, and ongoing-maintenance categories. Each card below carries the
machine-readable subset Solace can attest to today:

    intended_population      — who the model is for / contraindicated populations
    intended_output          — exactly what the model emits and how it is meant to be used
    data_provenance          — origin, lineage, consent basis, time range of training data
    risk_tier                — Solace internal risk classification (see RISK_TIERS)
    monitoring_plan          — post-deployment surveillance commitments
    synthetic_data_caveat    — whether synthetic / augmented data was used and where

Bias audit numbers
------------------
Demographic performance tables ship "empty-but-structured": every subgroup cell
is present with `value: null` and `status: "pending_prospective_data"` until the
prospective deployment cohort is large enough to publish real rates. This makes
the commitment auditable today and lets the same JSON shape carry real numbers
later with zero schema change. `compute_subgroup_rates()` is a real working
function — feed it confusion-matrix counts and it returns per-subgroup FNR/FPR,
disparate-impact ratios, and four-fifths-rule flags.

# a single object safe to render on a public website with NO auth.
#
# HARD CONSTRAINTS (enforced here, re-checked in tests):
#   1. AGGREGATE ONLY. Never per-record override entries. We compute rates and
#      counts from provenance.metrics() (which already strips PHI); we NEVER
#      touch provenance.overrides() raw rows, so patient_id / clinician_id /
#      free-text notes can never reach this payload.
#   2. HONEST LABELING. Calibration today comes from a SYNTHETIC validation
#      cohort with no real clinical outcome labels. Every calibration metric is
#      tagged provenance="synthetic validation cohort"; the report carries a
#      top-level disclaimer. We MUST NOT claim real-world clinical calibration.
