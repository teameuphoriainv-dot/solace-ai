"""The metadata catalog — controlled vocabulary + schema shape.

This is the ONLY description of the chart the planner model ever sees. It
describes the chart's *shape* and the value sets the planner may use as params.
It contains zero patient data. Every enum here is an allowlist: a plan param
that is not a member of one of these sets is rejected by the gate, which is what
structurally prevents the model from smuggling a raw value into a param.
