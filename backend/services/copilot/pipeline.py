"""Plan -> Execute -> Narrate orchestration.

Two model calls, both with fully controlled input:
  Pass 1 (plan):    catalog + question            -> QueryPlan (coded vocab only)
  Pass 2 (narrate): structured results + palette   -> artifact tree (refs only)

Between them sits the deterministic zone: gate -> executor -> (real PHI) ->
coded results + slot map. The slot map is returned to the router for rendering
and never enters a model call.
