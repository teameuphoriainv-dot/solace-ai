"""Letter / form library — auto-fill from chart context, render PDF.

Templates are house-style prose templates with named slot fields. The LLM fills
the slots from the chart context; deterministic Jinja-style rendering produces
the final document. PDF render via reportlab so the output is signable.

Each registry entry carries a stable shape:
  - name        : human-readable title
  - audience    : who receives the document
  - category    : grouping key (see CATEGORIES) for UI filtering
  - slots       : every slot the body references
  - required    : the subset of slots that MUST be present for a complete doc
  - guidance    : LLM-facing instructions for conservative, accurate filling

~22 forms ship today; the registry is open for new ones. Public surface kept
stable for routers/clinical_ai.py: list_templates, render_text, ai_fill_slots,
to_pdf. New: generate_letter (one-shot fill + render + gap-check) and
generate_batch (parallel fan-out).
