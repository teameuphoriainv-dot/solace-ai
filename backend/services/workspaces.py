"""Workspace service — multi-tenant sub-scope lifecycle within a hospital.

A **Workspace** is a sub-tenant scope WITHIN a hospital (e.g. a department, clinic,
or care team). The hospital (``hospital_id``) is the top-level tenant boundary — the
organization that adopted Solace. A workspace is a child scope owned by exactly one
hospital. This lets a single hospital partition its clinicians, patients lists, and
config across teams without standing up a separate tenant.

Layering (ARCH-001 / ARCH-002):
  - This service owns validation, ``workspace_id`` generation, and the cross-tenant
    ownership guard.
  - It reaches the datastore ONLY through ``db.storage`` — it never imports boto3.
  - The router imports this service and never touches DynamoDB directly.

Isolation (SEC-008 / COMP-011): every read/mutation is keyed by the owning
``hospital_id``. ``assert_owned`` is a defense-in-depth guard mirroring
``lib.tenant.assert_patient_in_hospital`` — it raises a uniform error so a caller
authenticated to hospital A can never observe (or even confirm the existence of) a
workspace owned by hospital B.
