"""ESI → next-step recommendation.

Closest competitor: Clearstep's Smart Care Routing. After triage, the patient
gets a one-shot recommendation with rationale + a CTA the result page renders
as the primary button.

Recommendations are pulled from the existing ESI level (so they stay coherent
with the conformal-prediction set + SHAP), augmented by transcript-keyword
red flags. Pure deterministic — runs in microseconds, no Claude call.

The recommendation is then refined for department capacity and patient age,
and carries a structured `next_steps` list the UI can render as a checklist.
