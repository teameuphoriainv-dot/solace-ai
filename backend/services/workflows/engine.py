"""Workflow execution engine.

`fire(event_name, hospital_id, context)` is called from anywhere a trigger
event happens (intake submit, mark-seen, pain flag, appointment booked, etc.).
The engine looks up enabled workflows for that trigger + hospital, sanitizes
the context for PHI, evaluates filters, and runs the action chain in order.
Each action result is logged.

Safety model:
  - PHI: `phi.sanitize_context()` runs once before any action sees the
    context — names, phones, emails, DOB, transcripts and addresses are
    stripped, opaque ids/hashes are kept. No handler ever receives raw PHI.
  - Bounded execution: a chain runs at most `MAX_STEPS` steps and each step is
    given at most `STEP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` of wall-clock time, so a runaway
    branch or a hung webhook cannot pin a daemon thread forever.
  - Conditional branching: a step may carry an `if` clause; when it does not
    match the (sanitized) context the step is skipped. A step may also set
    `goto` to jump to a named step, with a visited-cap that prevents loops.

Failures don't propagate — a broken workflow can't take down the patient flow
that fired the event. Errors are recorded against the workflow row so admins
see them on the dashboard.
