"""Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) — PRAPARE / AHC-HRSN social-needs screener.

This module turns a patient's answers to a validated social-needs instrument into:
  1. a scored risk profile  -> `screen()`
  2. ICD-10 Z-code billing diagnoses (Z55-Z65 SDoH family) -> `screen()` / `z_codes()`
  3. a closed-loop community-resource referral payload  -> `build_referral()`

Two instruments are supported, both mapped onto a shared internal domain model:
  - PRAPARE  — Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients' Assets, Risks
               and Experiences (NACHC). Richer, 21-domain.
  - AHC-HRSN — CMS Accountable Health Communities Health-Related Social Needs
               screening tool. 5 core domains (housing, food, transportation,
               utilities, interpersonal safety) plus supplemental.

The referral payload is shaped to drop straight into a FindHelp (Aunt Bertha) or
Unite Us closed-loop community-information-exchange API: a referral with a
resource category, consent flag, status lifecycle, and a feedback loop slot.

Pure functions — no I/O, no AI calls, no boto3 (ARCH-002). Routers persist the
output via db.storage; this module only computes.
