"""Transactional email — provider-agnostic sender.

Two providers behind one interface:
  - "ses"     — Amazon SES `send_email`. Production path. The sender identity
                (settings.email_from) must be a verified SES identity, and the
                account must be out of the SES sandbox to reach arbitrary
                recipients. Until then SES only delivers to verified addresses.
  - "console" — logs the message (and the magic link) instead of sending.
                Used in local mode and any time SES is not yet provisioned, so
                the onboarding flow is fully exercisable without a mailbox.

`solace_mode == "local"` always forces the console provider regardless of the
configured provider, so laptop dev never needs AWS credentials.

The magic-link sender returns a small result dict. When settings.email_dev_echo
is true (local/sandbox only — NEVER production) the dict carries `dev_link` so
callers can surface the link directly in an API response for testing.

    the link is the one way the sign-in flow can be completed. Console is forced
    in local mode and is never the production provider, so this cannot leak a
    login link from a real deployment.

    Without this, provisioning a workspace locally dead-ends: the workspace is
    created, the "check your email" screen renders, and no link ever arrives.
