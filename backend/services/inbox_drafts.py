"""Inbox auto-draft replies + abnormal-result patient communication.

Two related surfaces:

1. **Patient message reply draft** — given an inbound patient portal message + the
   patient's chart context, produce a clinician-edit-then-send draft. Safety:
   never suggests specific dosing, escalates to clinician for red-flag content,
   refuses topics outside scope (legal, financial), uses 6th-grade language.

2. **Abnormal lab/result reply** — same machinery but seeded with the abnormal
   result and reference range. Includes plain-language explanation, the action
   the clinician recommends, and clear next-step instructions.

Depth added in this revision:

- **Chart grounding** — the draft is checked, sentence by sentence, against the
  structured chart fields the model was given. Every clinical claim that maps
  to a chart field becomes a `grounding` citation; every clinical claim that
  does NOT map becomes an `ungrounded_claims` entry the clinician must verify
  before sending. This is the hallucination guardrail.

- **Urgency assessment** — `routine | same_day | emergent | crisis`, derived
  from red-flag detection plus the model's own read of the message, with the
  rule-based floor always winning (the model can escalate but never de-escalate).

- **One-click-send envelope** — a fully-formed `send_envelope` the UI can post
  back as-is. `auto_send_eligible` is **always False**: under FDA's
  human-in-the-loop carve-out for clinical decision support, a licensed
  clinician must review and press send. There is no code path that flips it.

Both surface a `requires_clinician_review` flag (always True) and a `red_flags`
list for triage routing.
