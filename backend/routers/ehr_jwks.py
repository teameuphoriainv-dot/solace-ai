"""Public JWKS endpoint for EHR confidential-client (private_key_jwt) auth.

When Solace authenticates to an EHR as a confidential client, it signs an RS384
``private_key_jwt`` assertion with a private key (held only in Secrets Manager).
The vendor (Epic, Oracle Health) verifies that signature against Solace's PUBLIC
key, which it fetches from a JWKS URL. This endpoint IS that URL:

    GET /.well-known/jwks.json  ->  {"keys": [ <public RSA JWK>, ... ]}

The served key set comes from the ``SOLACE_EHR_JWKS`` env var (a JSON
``{"keys": [...]}`` produced by ``scripts/setup_ehr_signing_key.py``). It contains
ONLY public key material — never the private key, never PHI — so the route is
intentionally unauthenticated and cacheable. A missing/malformed value yields an
empty key set (200) rather than an error, so the route never 500s.
