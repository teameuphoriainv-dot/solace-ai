"""Hospital workspace provisioning.

Public, unauthenticated onboarding endpoint. Each hospital that adopts Solace
gets its own unique URL-safe slug. The slug is also the hospital_id, so all
existing per-hospital routes (`/api/{hospital_id}/...`) and frontend paths
(`/h/{slug}/clinician`) work without any other change.

The legacy `demo` hospital keeps working untouched — it is seeded separately
by storage.seed_demo_hospital() and is not reachable through this router.

  - POST /hospitals/provision  — create a workspace, return its slug + URLs

This router is mounted WITHOUT the `/api/{hospital_id}` prefix because it
creates the hospital_id rather than operating inside one.
