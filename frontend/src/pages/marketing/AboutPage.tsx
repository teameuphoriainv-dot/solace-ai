              Solace started in an emergency department waiting room: watching people wait in pain to
              repeat their story three times, and watching clinicians spend their evenings typing instead
              of going home.
            </p>
            <p>
              The diagnosis was obvious and uncomfortable: the burden wasn't medicine, it was paperwork
              and blind spots. So we built the platform we wished existed: triage that understands
              patients from the first hello, documentation that writes itself while the clinician stays
              present, and a copilot that handles the chart's busywork without ever taking the pen out of
              a clinician's hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              We're a small team that ships fast and measures itself on one number: minutes returned to
              care.
